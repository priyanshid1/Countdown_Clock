# Countdown_Clock
HTML, CSS, Javascript

Hector wants you to create a countdown clock page for the Tulsa Summer Party held on July 4th of every year. 
He wants the page to show the current date and time and to include a timer that counts down to the start of the fireworks at 9 p.m. on the 4th.
Hector has already completed the page content and needs you to write the JavaScript code.
